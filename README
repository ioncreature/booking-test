This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what youâ€™re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. JQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required.

First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
7-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.

Second, pick one or two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever task you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.

Tasks
========================================

1.  Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Some ideas you may consider: include an automatic
	slideshow mode, add prev/next buttons to manually controll the carousel,
	add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text.

2.  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score.

3.  Improve the room table. Some ideas you may consider: allow the user to sort
	the rooms table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects
	a quantity, display additional information about rooms.

4.  Imagine there's a json feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design
	the json format and use it to display similar hotels on the page.

5.  Imagine there's a json feed with nearby landmarks. Design the json format
	and use it to display landmarks on the page.

6.  Improve the facilities block.

7.  Improve the hotel page however you see fit.



My decision
========================================

As a user of such systems first of all I look at the hotel photos. 
So I decided to assign highest priority to the 1st task.

1.  Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Some ideas you may consider: include an automatic
	slideshow mode, add prev/next buttons to manually controll the carousel,
	add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text.


I think we should add block with start price per night and/or "Book now" button
in the top of page.

2.  Improve the hotel page however you see fit.


It should be convenient for user to navigate through the similar hotels

3.  Imagine there's a json feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design
	the json format and use it to display similar hotels on the page.
	

It's useful
	
4.  Improve the room table. Some ideas you may consider: allow the user to sort
	the rooms table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects
	a quantity, display additional information about rooms.

	
It is important block for tourists

5.  Imagine there's a json feed with nearby landmarks. Design the json format
	and use it to display landmarks on the page.
	

I spend a lot of time studying the reviews. But I think that pagination can
make the user interface worse and force user to spend more time navigating 
through pages. Sort reviews by score is ok.

6.  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score.

	
I found facilities block easy and convenient, so I think improvements in this 
block is not necessary. If some hotel has more facilities we can add some 
grouping. But in this case everything is ok.
	
7.  Improve the facilities block.


NOTE:
I will implement 1st and 4th tasks from my list.
